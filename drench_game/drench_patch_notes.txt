v1.1
- Attacking your teammates in Lights Out will no longer give points, and killing your teammates in Duels will no longer count as your kill, meaning you won't get a full heal.
- Fixed all players earning points in Free-for-All duels, as if they were on the same team
- Fixed scoreboard in Team duels not displaying correcting in some situations
- Added a failsafe if a player is in the timer state for longer than expected, hopefully preventing players from getting stuck
